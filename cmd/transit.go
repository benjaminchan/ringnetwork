	filename := transitCmd.PersistentFlags().String("filename", "", "path to file")
	gate := transitCmd.PersistentFlags().String("gate", "", "name your transit")
	auth := transitCmd.PersistentFlags().String("auth", "", "enforce policy on transit")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// transitCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
